## Planning-and-Development-Code-Violations-Scottsdale

The City of Scottsdale publishes a [dataset](http://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/dataset/planning-and-development-code-violations)* that includes closed planning and development cases for one rolling year, updated weekly.  One of the characteristics that interests me about this dataset is that it includes the GIS coordinates of where the violations are located.  With both "open" and "close" dates for violations, this dataset creates a good oportunity to perform time series analysis

### How does the volume of cases opened and closed compare from day to day?

### There is a high level of variability from day to day.  How does the volume of cases opened and closed compare from month to month?

### Although the volume of violations tracks quite closely, why is there a spike between August and November?  Do any specific violation category contribute most to the spike at this time of year?

#### To Investigate:

1. How are various code violations geographically distributed throughout the city?
2. Do some code violations take place more frequently at one time of year than another?
   * Most violations relate to landscaping(grass too long, dead shrub, ect.) and track consistently with periods of rain, and lack therof throughout the year.
3. Based on different types of violations, what is the difference in time between when a complaint is received and when it is closed?  What does this say about how different sorts of code violations are enforced?
