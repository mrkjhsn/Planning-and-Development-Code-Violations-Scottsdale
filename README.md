## Planning-and-Development-Code-Violations-Scottsdale

The City of Scottsdale publishes a [dataset](http://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/dataset/planning-and-development-code-violations)* that includes closed planning and development cases for one rolling year, updated weekly.  One of the characteristics that interests me about this dataset is that it includes the GIS coordinates of where the violations are located.  With both "open" and "close" dates for violations, this dataset creates a good oportunity to perform time series analysis
___
#### To investigate further:
1. How are various code violations geographically distributed throughout the city?
3. Based on different types of violations, what is the difference in time between when a complaint is received and when it is closed?  What does this say about how different sorts of code violations are enforced?
