### Which code violations are clustered farthest from the mean location of all code violations?
Process:  I found the mean longitude and latitude coordinates for each code violation group, as well as for all code violations as a whole.  Next, I used the pythagorean theorem to find the distance of of each group from the mean for all.  Finally I sorted to show the code violations with greatest distances at the top.  The size of the colored circles corresponds to the number of code violations within that group.  Small blue dots below show the location of each code violation.  Dashed lines show the the mean latitude and longitude of all code violations.
